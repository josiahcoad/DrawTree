# Welcome to DrawTree!
-----------------------
![](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4a2cbee653c8636a069ef0d9fa0b08fa)

* last week I spent hours drawing about binary trees like the one above on powerpoint for a CS assignment... we could make the process *much* faster and prettier :)
* The goal of this project is to create a super simple and intuitive way to draw trees (and eventually graphs, state machines, etc)
* *lets focus right on binary trees right now* :)
* The intentions are mostly for academic use whenever we need graphics of node or state relations
* What exists right now for this is easy VERY clumbersome (Paint, Powerpoint) or overly complex (Latex)
* once decent progress is made, the goal is to serve it as a static website for anyone to use

### What do you need to know to contribute?
* languages: CSS, HTML, javascript
* libraries: paperjs ([get familar with paperjs](http://paperjs.org/))

### What needs done?
* paper js
	- [x] circles appear on screen where clicked
	- [x] lines drawn between nodes when new node placed in a new place
	- [ ] click nodes to select them (show through them being "highlighted")
	- [ ] when a node is highlighted and you click somewhere new, the line should go from the highlighted to the new node
	- [ ] allow adding text inside the nodes
	- [ ] make nodes grow with additional text
	- [ ] make nodes autoformat vertically and horizontally into a nice binary tree when autoformat is turned on 

* page in general
	- [ ] canvas screenshot button
	- [ ] Binary Tree autoformat "switch" like this:
![switch example](http://craftedpixelz.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/screenshot-toggle.jpg)
	- [ ] could have preference options for color, node shape, etc.
	- [ ] open to all ideas!! Please add away... think what you would want to use:)
